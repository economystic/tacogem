Calculation of Water: 
*The average price from DSI database on water user assoc. is 138.6 TL/Ha. for 2006. We increased this price by the increase in the price of housing water servicesto reach 2008 price. Price was 2.7278 in 2006 January and increased to 2,9462 in 2008 December (TUIK) indicating an 8 percent increase. Hence we used 149.7 TL/Ha as 2008 price per ha. Thus the money paid to water is calculated by multiplying 5.28 million (DSI,2007) Ha. with this price which equals 790,400,000 TL. 
VA of Irrigated land is calculated by obeying Dudu et al (2010), twice the money paid to irrigation. Then the income generated by irrigated land is distributed to HHs according to their share in income generated by rainfed land.
Income generated by water as a production factor is also distributed to HHs according to their share in income generated by capital which is distributed through firms. Hence payments from capital to firms is discounted by the total amount of income generated by water. Then payments from firms to HHs is also discounted by the amount of income that each HHs receives from water factor. 
*Total water used by municipalities as utility water is reported to be   4.557.074 for 2008 by TUIK (website - 2010). 
*VA for irrigated land is assumed to be 20 percent more than (by obeying the rule in yields) rainfed land and solved rentXrainfed+(rentX1.2)Xirrigated=(capital value added)X(0.2).
Agricultural Value added is distributed according to 2008 TUIK data (Regional Database). I/O is also distributed according to regions shares in value added. 
Value added and I/O in the rest of the sectors are distributed according to the number of insured people in 2008. (SGK, 2008)
Regional disaggregation is done by using TUIK's Regional Foreign Trade database for the Year 2008. Agriculture, energy, Manufacturing and Services is disaggregated directly by using the shares of regions in the trade of these sectors. For exports of food and textile sectors regional trade data is not available. Hence we made an adjustment both share of region in the national production of that sector and region's share in the trade of manufacturing. Formula used is [Xr/SUM(Xr)*Yr/SUM(Yr)]/SUM[Xr/SUM(Xr)*Yr/SUM(Yr)]  where X is regions production in the sector and Yr is volume of regions trade in manufacturing. We ignored the final shares that are less than 1 percent. For imports we used the regions share in manufacturing trade directly.
Consumption is disaggregated according to TUIK 2003 HH consumption data. We assume that share of a commodity in the total consumption of a HH type does not change across regions. We also assume that HHs does not consume any commodities from other regions.
Government consumption is distributed according to the 2008 Public Accounts Bulletin of General Directorate of Public Accounts (muhasebat, 2010). Government consumption in each sector is distributed according to the region's share in total government expenditures on goods and services purchases. 

Transfers are also distributed according to 2008 Public Accounts Bulletin of General Directorate of Public Accounts. 

Investment in different sectors are distributed according to region's share in value added. 

The flow from commodity accounts to Activity accounts is the key regional interaction term. Interregional trade is calculated as a residual and any transportation cost is ignored. We first found the difference between a region's production and consumption. Then we distributed the difference as a transfer from other regions according to the share of other regions in national production. Regions of which production exceeds consumption are assumed to consume only their own products and export rest of the prouducts to other regions. Hence their intersectoral trade is zero. For importing regions, the imported amount is discounted from the region's production to keep the balance between consumption and production.  That is we assume that interregional trade is done among producers of exporting region and wholesalers of importing region. Hence value added produced in a region also includes the value of commodities obtained by trade. A better alternative would have been introducing interregional trade through households but due to lack of data this option is not viable for the current model. 



Factor incomes are distributed according to shares of regions in factor value added. After finding the share of each region in factor income, income is distributed according to the orginal shares of HH types in national incomes. 

Profit transfers are distributed according to shares of regions in national capital income. 

Transfers to households from SSI are distributed according to SSI Yearbook 2008,  NUMBER OF PERSON IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY COVERAGE AND RATE TO THE TURKEY POPULATION. We used the regions' share in number of people receiving pension. 
Other transfers from government to households are distributed according to 2009 Annual Report of SSocial Assistance and Solidarity Fund by looking at the shares of regions in total transfers. 
Government savings and payments to ROW by government as well as tax incomes of government are not distributed since both accounts are national.

Tax payments of domestic institutions are distributed according to the 2008 Accrued and Realized Cumulative Tax Incomes in General Budget that is published by General Directorate of Public Accounts. We used accrued tax amounts in calculating the shares.
